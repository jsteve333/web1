Cascading Style Sheets are designed to, well, cascade.
Important declarations overrides the cascading nature of CSS and are often considered to be a hack.
You should avoid using them for the most part. But like most things proposed to the CSS spec, important has several practical applications.
But what are they?
First we need to travel back in time. Long before media queries and responsive design.
The important keyword was first introduced in CSS1 as a way to increase the specificity of CSS declarations.
But it did something rather strange.
Author stylesheets are included by web developers in a web page to style the page.
User styles are defined by the user often in their browser preferences.
It makes sense that a user style should always override author styles, but that wasn’t always the case.
The CSS authors made an important decision to make important declarations in user style sheets the most specific of them all. 
A user should have the final say in the styles they are presented with.
This isn’t the only advantage to the changes made in the CSS2 spec however.
Inadvertently, this ruling also allows web developers to use important declarations freely without concern of overriding important user styles.
